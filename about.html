            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Paul Bernay and I am a current student at The Ohio
              State University set to graduate in May 2024. My hometown is
              Reynoldsburg, Ohio which is about a 30 minute drive from Columbus.
              I really like the city of Columbus and think it has great
              potential so I really would like to stay here for a job.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently looking for a job to start my career. I was
              thinking of some sort of entry level analyst or something that
              could properly use my specialization, Information Systems.
              Although that is the case I have a good feeling that I could
              prosper in any role that I would be put in but I would deliver the
              most company value in a role that I enjoy. Ideally my career path
              would include a role that allows me to be the liaison between
              business teams and IT development teams.

            <h2>Main Interests</h2>
            <p>
              My main interests are in computers and how they work. I have built
              a good number of computers in my history, that includes for my
              friends, parents, and myself. Mainly the computers are made for
              gaming but I have started to dabble in servers, so using some of
              me and my friends' old parts we made a home server. This interest
              helped me choose information systems as a major.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of my other interests are in money and how to make the most
              of money. This interest really pushed me toward a business degree
              and why I am in the Fisher College of Business. To expand on that
              I have a passion toward the operations side of things, ie making
              processes more efficient. That is shown in another passion for
              video games; I really enjoy strategy video games especially
              business focused games, one of my favorite being Rollercoaster
              Tycoon(1999). I also have shown a little passion in personal
              finance: I have a Roth IRA, made lots of money on cryptocurrency,
              I have a personal account for trading, and have used options(and
              know how they work).

            <h2>Main Skills</h2>
            <h3>Behavioral Skills</h3>
            <p>
              My main behavioral skills are: inquisitive, customer service,
              stress management, teamwork, and time management. I will go over
              why or how I got these skills one by one. I am inquisitive because
              I really like to learn and grow my knowledge on lots of subjects.
              Currently I have a broad knowledge on a lot of technology and
              business terms/strategy but have really not dug down on a specific
              thing. I have really good customer service because I work in one
              of the busiest Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants that they have. This
              brings a heavy amount of people that are not the greatest in terms
              of kindness but we have to make sure to ease situations and still
              deliver good service. My stress management has been built over
              time. Many of my peers say I am a very calm person under pressure.
              This skill has been really tested when we have had some record
              sales days with me under expo at Buffalo Wild Wings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Time management is something that you really get tested at
              college. You are trying to balance five classes with five projects
              due and an exam coming up that week. That really puts the pressure
              on you to get things done either ahead of time or just make the
              deadline. Having good teamwork is something that is vital in all
              parts of life and can be applied mostly everywhere. Even with its
              widespread application it is really important to be able to mesh
              with a team so that you can meet the delivery times required. This
              has been applied especially in university because of the large
              number of team projects that we have but could also be applied to
              my work experience in the restaurant industry.
            </p>
            <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
            <p>
              Going over the technical skills, I will break them down into some
              categories and explain them:
            </p>
            <h4>Coding Languages</h4>
            <p>SQL, Python, and Java</p>
            <p>
              I have used each of these languages in my projects and was taught
              SQL and Java at OSU.
            </p>
            <h4>Computer Skills</h4>
            <p>
              Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, Windows, GitHub, Eclipse,
              VSCode, and Autodesk Inventor
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of these skills were learned at OSU. I would say the top
              computer skills I have are Excel, Windows, and GitHub. When I say
              windows I mean that I can reliably fix a problem that a windows
              computer has and I have a broad knowledge of how it works.
