            <h2>Work Expierence</h2>
            <h3>Buffalo Wild Wings</h3>
            <p>
              I am currently employed with Buffalo Wild Wings and work as a food
              expo/cashier. My other positions include server and greeter. I am
              one of the certified trainers for the cashier/expo/greeter, I have
              been able to successfully train 10+ people since becoming a
              certified trainer. Each of the positions have been able to
              successfully build on my behavioral skill set and I am hopeful
              that I will be able to apply this to my career. I will outline
              each position below with what was done in the role and how it
              impacted my skill set.
            </p>
            <h4>Food Expo</h4>
            <p>
              Food Expo has been the position that I have excelled at and spent
              most of my time working. As the food expo role I am responsible
              for the food being correct on the plate and for takeout. At our
              Buffalo Wild Wings we have beaten record sales numbers out of all
              the stores so it can be a very stressful role. We have to be able
              to manage our time as well as contain our stress so that we can
              work at a sustained level. One of the key aspects of this position
              is to make sure to be open and timely on things that have messed
              up along the chain. For example, say that the server delivered the
              food to the wrong table. We have to communicate that mistake to
              the kitchen so that we can get it made right and timely. In
              summary the main skills would be teamwork, clear communications,
              time management, and stress management.
            </p>
            <h4>Cashier</h4>
            <p>
              As a cashier I am responsible for making sure that takeout runs
              smoothly. This includes getting a customer an order and stocking
              up the portions that we have to make. The hardest part of this job
              by far is the customer interaction because if something is messed
              up then we have to respectfully tell the customer the bad news.
              This can be incredibly difficult because our food is really
              overpriced so we have to try to deliver the best customer
              experience that we can give. We also have to communicate to the
              expo if the food is messed up and we need something remade. The
              main skills that I learned from this job would have to be teamwork
              and customer service.
            </p>
            <h4>Server</h4>
            <p>
              As a server or waiter you have to ensure that you deliver the best
              experience for the customer because they are your paycheck. You
              have to be able to understand where a customer is coming from when
              they are feeling dissatisfied. The main skill for this role has to
              be a large focus on customer service.
            </p>
            <h3>Loeb Electric</h3>
            <p>
              At Loeb Electric I was a warehouse specialist where I was able to
              pick and audit orders. They normally did not hire high school
              students so I was able to work part-time for them. They are a
              smaller company so they had more of a barebones WMS but I did get
              to work with it a little bit by picking and auditing.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had lots of experience auditing because no one else did it so I
              stepped up to do it. When you audit you have to make sure that the
              order that was just picked was correct. If the order was not
              correct you would need to communicate to the pickers to help you
              grab the right item or put one back in the right place. So the
              main skills I was able to pick up on would have to be teamwork and
              communication.
            </p>
            <h3>Raising Canes</h3>
            <p>
              At Canes I was a kitchen member and we were responsible for
              creating the food as well as the inside expo for the takeout and
              dine-in. I was able to do all of the jobs in the kitchen so I was
              able to grasp a knowledge of everything that was being done within
              the back house. Some of the main skills that I was very new
              to(this was my first job) were the idea of time management and
              teamwork. We have to make sure that our times to make our food as
              well as quantity of food are right so that we can keep the
              customer experience high. We can keep our times down by
              communicating with our other kitchen members.

            <h3>The Ohio State University</h3>
            <p>
              I am currently a senior at OSU within the Fisher College of
              Business studying Business Administration with a specialization in
              Management Information Systems(MIS). I will graduate in May 2024
              with a bachelor of science in Business Administration.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started my journey at OSU as an economics specialization because
              I really enjoyed the OSU econ class I took in high school. I soon
              realized that I did not like economics but I kept it on as a minor
              while I switched to Information Systems. I made this switch
              because I really wanted to stay in business because of my love for
              making things more efficient but I also have a love of computers.
              I was not aware that this specialization existed and it is a
              really small specialization inside of Fisher.
            </p>
            <p>
              Information Systems within Fisher focuses heavily on managing IT
              and digital workplaces. It is a high level company strategy driven
              major and focuses less on the technical side of IT. This major is
              able to set us up to have a broad knowledge of systems used and
              how to develop/maintain software or systems. I have been able to
              broaden my technical skills through the personal projects that I
              have recently started. Some of the relevant courses that I have
              are Business Systems Application Development, Microsoft
              Excel/Access, 2 Java focused classes(other classes also used
              Java), and Introduction to Database Systems(SQL).

            <h3>Robotics Team</h3>
            <p>
              In high school, I was involved on our F.I.R.S.T Robotics Team, our
              team name was Technical Difficulties(Number 4085). Our goal each
              season was to create a robot that would complete tasks against
              another team trying to do the same tasks. We would have
              competitions throughout the midwest.
            </p>
            <p>
              There were multiple sub-teams within our robotics team, I was part
              of a subteam called CAD. It was our goal to design the robot and
              other parts within a software called Autodesk Inventor, previously
              before joining the team I already had 1 year of working with
              Inventor. After starting on the team I was promoted to lead of the
              CAD team for a year and I was able to lead a team of 5 while doing
              our CAD responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a year I wanted to take the sub-team in a different
              direction because we had a growing number of projects not
              specifically dealing with the robot. So I wanted to create a team
              that would be able to work on specialized projects(Robot Cart and
              Demonstration Robot), I called this team the Design team. We were
              able to create a new Robot Cart and place to hold the controllers
              during play. During this time I was also able to start on the Demo
              Robot but was not able to complete the project.

            <h3>Common Cents Investment Group</h3>
            <p>
              I was in this club during my sophomore year of college and was
              recommended by a friend to join this club due to my interest in
              trading. This club felt almost like another class that was very
              informative on everything to do with stock trading. A notable
              activity that we did was have a mock trading competition with
              everyone on the team. Now because the club felt more like a class
              I was not really interested in staying with the club and left
              after a year of attending but it was really informative.
